The Genomic Insight project is a tool for analysing genomic data. It includes calculating GC content, searching for nucleotide motifs and performing BLAST analysis to compare protein sequences.
## Main Functions
- *GC-content: Determining the percentage of GC content in a genomic sequence.
- *Motifs*: Finding the occurrence frequency of specific nucleotide motifs.
- *BLAST analysis*: Identification of protein sequence analogues using BLAST.
- *Visualisation*: Graphical representation of motif distribution and BLAST results.
